# Welcome to My Repo. for NLP Specialization by *DeepLearning.ai* 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### In this course I learned all about text, how to interpret it and how to manipulate it.
### I learned all about the techniques that's used in natural language processing, like:
	- CBOW
	- Probability models
	- Sentiment Analysis
	- Word Embeddings
	- LSH 
	- POS
	- N-grams
	- GRU's
	- RNN's
	- LSTM's
	- Transformers
	- Attention layers
	- Siamese model
	- Triplet loss
	- Reformers

## The projects I've done in this course:
### The basic part :
	### Course 1
	- Words and Frequency representation
	- Sentemint Analysis using Naive Bayes
	- Predict relationships among words using PCA
	- Naive Machine Translation and LSH
	### Course 2
	- Auto Correct system
	- Parts-of-Speech Tagging (POS)
	- Language Models Auto-Complete System
	- Word Embeddings and the CBOW model
### The Advanced models, using Trax Framework :
	### Course 3
	- Sentiment Analysis with Deep Neural Networks
	- Deep N-grams
	- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
	- Question duplicates
	### Course 4
	- Calculating the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score
	- Neural Machine Translation
	- Transformer Summarizer
	- SentencePiece and BPE
	- T5 SQuAD Model using Colab
	- Question Answering using T5
	- BERT Loss Model using Colab
	- Chatbot using trax reformer
